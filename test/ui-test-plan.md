# Janet UI test plan

The runner executes each test case in order. Expected output is compared exactly.
Each case runs in a fresh temporary folder. Cases may provide an initial data file or assert the saved file.

The JavaFX cases below are manual because the command-line runner has no graphical display. Run Janet with
`./gradlew run`, perform each case in order, and close the window before starting the next case.

## Manual GUI test: Start and add a task

Enter `todo read book`, followed by `list`. Verify that the window opens at a usable size, shows the welcome bubble,
accepts input by Enter and the Send button, displays distinct user and Janet bubbles, and lists the new task. Verify
that the header, composer, badges, and bubbles use a warm pastel-purple palette with readable contrast.

## Manual GUI test: Reject malformed input without changing state

After adding `read book`, enter `todo`, followed by `list`. Verify that Janet shows the missing-description error and
that the list still contains exactly the original task. Verify that the error uses the pink error bubble and `!` badge,
while the valid list reply uses Janet's cream bubble and `J` badge.

## Manual GUI test: Show and enforce a saved-data warning

Place one valid row followed by one malformed row in `data/janet.txt`, then start Janet. Verify that a warning bubble
identifies line 2, `list` shows the valid task, and an add command is rejected without overwriting the original file.

## Manual GUI test: Update an existing task

After adding one task, enter `mark 1`, followed by `list`. Verify that Janet confirms the change and displays `[X]`.

## Manual GUI test: Reject an invalid task number

After marking task 1, enter `delete 0`, followed by `list`. Verify that Janet reports the invalid number and the marked
task remains in the list.

## Manual GUI test: Display long conversations and messages

Resize the window to its minimum size, enter a description longer than the visible input field, and then add enough
tasks to fill the conversation. Verify that bubbles wrap without clipping and the view scrolls to the latest reply.

## Manual GUI test: Exit using the bye command

Enter `  bye  `. Verify that Janet displays its goodbye response, disables further input, and closes after a short
delay even though the command contains surrounding spaces.

## Test case: Find tasks by keyword

Aim: Verify that Janet displays tasks whose descriptions contain a keyword and rejects an empty keyword without changing the list.

### Inputs
